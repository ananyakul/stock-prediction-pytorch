# Stock Prediction Algorithm Using PyTorch

Welcome to the Stock Prediction Algorithm project! This repository contains a PyTorch-based machine learning model designed to predict stock prices using historical data. Our goal is to provide a practical, accessible tool for financial analysis and predictive modeling.

## Features

- Data preprocessing for historical stock data.
- LSTM neural network model for time series prediction.
- Training and validation scripts.
- Future stock price prediction.
- Visualization tools for predicted vs. actual prices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
